# Master Thesis 2021/2022

This is a repository for my Master Thesis at TUM, starting from WS 21/22, which would complete my Master degree of Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence. The thesis is expected to last 6 months. The general idea of thesis: train a multi-view stereopsis (MVS) model to reconstruct a 3D model from a set of 2D RGB images, then use the weights as pretrained features for downstream task of semantic segmentation. Thesis is done under supervision of Prof. Matthias Nie√üner at Chair of Visual Computing & Artificial Intelligence.
